## FEATURES

***Spectral - Passive:*** The Wraith is immune to physical damage and weak against magic damage. Additionally, the Wraith can move through solid objects.

***Spooky - Passive:*** When the Wraith makes a successful attack, all PCs within Close range must mark a Stress and you gain a Fear.

***Nightmare Shroud - Action:*** **Spend a Fear** to have the Wraith wrap themself around a PC within Melee range, making them Shrouded until they or an ally succeed on a Strength or Attack Roll (20) to dislodge the Wraith. If itâ€™s an attack roll, the Shrouded PC takes the damage. While Shrouded, a PC has disadvantage on all attacks and marks a Stress when they roll with Fear.
