## FEATURES

***Relentless (X) - Passive:*** Xero can be spotlighted up to X times per GM turn, where X is the number of PCs in the scene. Spend Fear as usual to spotlight them.

***Collateral Damage - Passive:*** Xero’s movement cannot be hindered, impeded, or affected by any external effect. All destructible terrain or obstacles in Xero’s path are destroyed when Xero moves through them.

***Gigaton Stomp - Action:*** **Spend a Fear** to have Xero bring their foot down hard, creating a localized earthquake. All creatures within Melee range take **4d12** physical damage and are Restrained until they succeed on a Finesse Roll to slide out from underfoot. All creatures outside of Melee range and within Close range must succeed on an Instinct Reaction Roll or be knocked back up to Far range. If a target is knocked back, they must mark an Armor Slot or take **4d12** physical damage as they land.

***Power Slide - Action:*** **Mark a Stress** to move Xero up to Close range. All creatures Xero moves through must make a Strength Reaction Roll. Targets who fail must mark 2 Armor Slots or take Severe Damage.

***Radioactive Breath - Action:*** **Spend a Fear** to have Xero charge up a nuclear beam and place a token on this stat block. The next time Xero takes the spotlight, you can **spend this token** and unleash the beam. Draw a line with a Close range width from Xero to the edge of the battlefield. All PCs within this path must make an Agility Reaction Roll. Targets who faill take **4d12+12** direct magic damage. Targets who succeed take half damage. Xero can’t use this action again until they take Severe damage.

***Regeneration - Action:*** Up to three times per scene, **spend any number of Fear** to clear an equal number of HP.
