## FEATURES

***Doppel-Dangler - Action:*** The membranous cluster at the end of the Beguiler’s head stalk can shapeshift into any humanoid form. **Mark a Stress** and choose a PC within Close range. Their player must tell you what form their PC would find most trustworthy (such as a relative, mentor, or lover). The Beguiler’s head stalk transforms into that shape.

***Entice - Action:*** **Spend a Fear** to play an alluring overture to a PC within Close range. The PC must succeed on a Presence Reaction Roll (18) or move into Melee range with the Beguiler. If the Beguiler’s head stalk is in a form the PC would find trustworthy, they have disadvantage on the reaction roll.

***Entangle - Reaction:*** When a PC moves within Melee range, you can **spend a Fear** to make an attack against them. On a successful attack, the target is Swallowed. While Swallowed, a creature is Restrained and can only take actions to attack the Beguiler. The Beguiler disgorges all Swallowed creatures when they take Major damage.

***Rest and Digest - Reaction:*** When the Beguiler takes the spotlight with a Swallowed creature inside them, they move to Far range away from the PCs.
