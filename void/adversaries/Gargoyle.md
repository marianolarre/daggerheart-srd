## FEATURES

***Stone Body - Passive:*** The Gargoyle is resistant to physical damage.

***Just a Statue - Passive:*** Before they make their first attack in a fight or after they become Hidden, the Gargoyle is indistinguishable from a normal statue until they next act or a PC succeeds on an Instinct Roll to identify them.

***Swooping Strike - Action:*** Choose a point within Far range. The Gargoyle moves to that point in a straight line and makes an attack against one target along its path.
