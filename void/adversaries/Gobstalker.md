## FEATURES

***Relentless (3) - Passive:*** The Gobstalker can be spotlighted up to three times per GM turn. Spend Fear as usual to spotlight them.

***Anti-mystica-halitosis - Passive:*** A Gobstalker’s breath is so rancid it creates an invisible miasma that negates magical effects. Any attack that deals magic damage or creates a magical effect in front of the Gobstalker within Close range automatically fails. This feature does not affect the Gobstalker’s own features.

***Eyestalks - Action:*** **Mark a Stress** to attack a target within Far range. On a hit, spend a Fear to choose an effect or roll a d10 for a random effect. The Gobstalker uses the corresponding magical beam:
1. **Beguile.** The target is Beguiled and sees the Gobstalker as a friend. A Beguiled creature cannot attack the Gobstalker. Additionally, a Beguiled PC must mark a Stress or make a standard attack against their nearest ally whenever someone rolls with Fear. This effect lasts until the targets succeeds on a Presence or Knowledge Roll (16).
2. **Corrode.** The target takes 2d8 magical damage and marks an Armor Slot without receiving its benefits (they can still use armor to reduce the damage). If all the target’s Armor Slots are already marked, double the damage.
3. **Doom.** The target immediately marks all cleared HP, but can reduce the number of HP marked this way by spending any number of Hope. For each Hope spent in this way, reduce the number of HP marked by 1.
4. **Hypnosis.** The target falls into a deep, sleeplike trance and can’t take any actions except for trying to wake up. The target wakes up when they are hit by an attack, mark 1 or more HP, or succeed on an Instinct Roll (16) to wake up.
5. **Paralyze.** The target freezes in place, becoming Vulnerable and Restrained until they mark 2 Stress.
6. **Petrify.** Place a Petrification Countdown (6) on the target. It ticks down when a PC rolls with Fear. When it triggers, the target turns to stone until the Gobstalker is defeated or they take a long rest. While stone, the target is immune to all damage and aware of their surroundings, but cannot take actions.
7. **Push.** The target is thrown up to Far range and takes 3d6 physical damage from whatever they hit.
8. **Sear.** The target takes 2d8 direct magical damage.
9. **Slow.** The target is Vulnerable and must mark a Stress to move. The target can spend 2 Hope at any time to end this effect.
10. **Terrify.** The target can’t act except to flee the battle or try to shake off their fear with a successful Insight Roll (16). Additionally, whenever you spend Fear, the target must mark a Stress. This effect lasts until the Gobstalker is defeated or the target takes a rest.
