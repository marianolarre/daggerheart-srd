## FEATURES

***Ill Omen - Passive:*** When a PC within Close range makes an action roll, their Fear Die gains a bonus equal to the amount of Fear you currently have.

***Witch Barrier - Passive:*** The Owl Witch is resistant to magic damage.

***Alluring Voice - Action:*** The Owl Witch can perfectly mimic the voice of a loved one or trusted figure. **Spend a Fear** to have the Owl Witch call out to a creature within earshot. The target must succeed on an Instinct Reaction Roll or move up to Far range toward the Owl Witch.

***Nightmare Stare - Action:*** **Spend a Fear** to have the Owl Witch Afflict a target within Far range with waking nightmares. Until a PC uses a downtime move to comfort the Afflicted creature and clear the condition, the Afflicted creature canâ€™t clear Stress or HP by any means.

***Visions of a Violent End - Reaction:*** When the Owl Witch is targeted by an attack, you can **spend a Fear** to force the attacker to make a Presence Reaction Roll. On a failure, they mark **1d4** Stress as their mind is flooded with visions of their own violent death.
