## FEATURES

***Horde (2d8+3) - Passive:*** When the Choir has marked half or more of their HP, their standard attack deals 2d8+3 magic damage instead.

***Aural Assault - Action:*** **Spend a Fear** to have the Choir unleash divine energy. Remove all tokens from this stat block (see “Celestia Coda”). For each token removed, deal **1d12** direct magic damage to all enemies within Close range.

***Celestial Coda - Reaction:*** Countdown (Loop 3). The Choir’s divine song builds on itself with each refrain. Activate the countdown when the Choir is first spotlighted. It ticks down on every action roll. When it triggers, place a token on this stat block. The Choir gains a bonus to their Difficulty and standard attack damage equal to the number of tokens on this stat block.
