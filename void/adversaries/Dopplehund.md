## FEATURES

***Blink Beast - Passive:*** When combat begins, place a duplicate within Close range of the Doppelhünd. The duplicate can move when the Doppelhünd is spotlighted, and the Doppelhünd can target enemies with attacks as if they’re in the same place as their duplicate. The Doppelhünd occupies both places until attacked, at which point you roll a d6 to determine whether the attack is targeting the Doppelhünd (the result is an even number) or their duplicate (the result is an odd number). Attacks against the duplicate automatically fail. A successful attack against the Doppelhünd dispels the duplicate until you **spend a Fear** to conjure it again.

***Double Lash - Reaction:*** When the Doppelhünd makes a standard attack, you can **mark a Stress** to make an additional standard attack. If both attacks target the same creature, combine the damage.
