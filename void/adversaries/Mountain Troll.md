## FEATURES

***Relentless (3) - Passive:*** The Troll can be spotlighted up to three times per GM turn. Spend Fear as usual to spotlight them.

***Stolen Armor - Passive:*** When combat begins, active a Countdown equal to the number of PCs. Whenever the Troll takes damage, tick down the countdown and reduce the HP the Troll marks by 1. When it triggers, the Troll evolves into an Enraged Mountain Troll (see “Enraged Mountain Troll - Evolution”).

***Flail Swipe - Action:*** The Troll swings their skull flail in a wide arc. **Mark a Stress** to make an attack against all targets in front of the Troll within Very Close range. On a success, the Troll deals **2d10+3** instead of its normal damage. The Troll cannot use this action while evolved. 

***Enraged Mountain Troll - Evolution:*** The Troll gains a +1 bonus to their Difficulty and their standard attack changes to the following:
**Claw Swipe:** Very Close | 1d8+1 phy
**Double Swipe - Action:** Spend a Fear to move the Troll up to Close range and immediately make two standard attacks against a single target within Melee range. If both attacks hit, combine the damage and the target also loses a Hope.
