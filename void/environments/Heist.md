## FEATURES

***Prep Work - Passive:*** Prior to the Heist, each PC has the opportunity to gather a key piece of information, surveil the location, or acquire a helpful tool or resource. Give each player the opportunity to describe one obstacle they expect to encounter and how they set themselves up to overcome it, then have them make an action roll. On a success, they get the advantage or asset they sought. On a success with Fear, it’s less useful than they expected (for example, they discover the location of a hidden access point but learn that breaching it will likely be diffi cult and noisy).
*How does the PC gain this advantage? Do they go it alone or ask for help? What unforeseen complications arise during the Heist itself?*

***Infiltration - Passive:*** Establish the goal of the Heist and start two dynamic countdowns: a Progress Countdown (12) to represent the party’s work toward their goal and a Consequence Countdown (10) to represent the rising risk of discovery and capture. Advance both according to the Dynamic Countdown Advancement table as the PCs make action rolls to complete the Heist. If the Progress Countdown triggers first, spotlight this environment to use the “Exfiltration” feature. If the Consequence Countdown triggers first, gain **1d4** Fear, splotlight this environment, and use the “Sound the Alarm” feature.
*What is the party going after, and where is it located? What unexpected obstacles will they encounter? What happens if the party gets caught?*

***Saw This Coming - Passive:*** Once per session, a PC can spend a Hope to explain how they prepared for the current situation and reveal a key piece of information (such as the location of a hidden passage or the password to a restricted area) or produce a helpful item (such as a cultist’s uniform left unattended or a common consumable hidden in their boot). 
*What did the PC prepare in advance? How did they know they’d need it? What did it cost them to set up, or whom do they owe a favor to?*

***Exfiltration - Reaction:*** When the Progress Countdown triggers, the party acquires the object of the Heist and must succeed on a group action roll to escape without being caught. On a failure, each PC marks a Stress and takes **2d12** direct damage.
*What makes getting out even more dangerous than getting in? What unforeseen developments stymie the party’s original escape plan?*

***Sound the Alarm - Reaction:*** When the Consequence Countdown triggers, the party is discovered and the location enters High Alert. Immediately summon a number of Tier 2 adversaries equal to the number of PCs in the scene and spotlight one. While this environment is on High Alert, all adversaries gain a +1 bonus to their Difficulty.
*What makes these adversaries uniquely suited to guard this location? What do they know about this place that gives them an edge?*
