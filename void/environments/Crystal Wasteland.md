## FEATURES

***Harmonic Resonance - Passive:*** The crystals here reverberate with magical energy. A PC can make a downtime move to try and Attune to the environment with a successful Spellcast Roll. Spellcast Rolls made by an Attuned PC inside the Crystal Wasteland have advantage. A PC clears the condition when they leave the wasteland.
*How does attunement to this place alter your sensory experience of it? What sound or song from your childhood does this place conjure?*

***Gravitational Anomalies - Action:*** Strange, localized phenomena dot the landscape, warping distance and direction. **Spend a Fear** to alter the gravity at a point of your choice. All targets within Close range of that point must make a Knowledge Reaction Roll to calculate their new trajectories. Targets who fail take **3d8+4** physical damage as they are thrown up and away. Targets who succeed must mark a Stress or take half damage.
*What does it feel like as your body and mind fight to re-establish equilibrium? Is there any way to use this to your advantage?*

***Arcane Reflection - Action:*** **Spend a Fear** to have any number of PCs glimpse a reflection in the crystal of who they once were or might become. Each target makes a Fate Roll. Targets who succeed see a vision of their better self and can replace one Experience. Targets see a vision of their dark past–or an even darker future–and must mark a Stress, and you gain a fear.
*Who do the PCs see on the other side of the crystal? How does it make them feel?*

***Razor-Sharp Terrain - Reaction:*** When a PC fails a roll to navigate the wasteland, they make a Finesse Reaction Roll. On a failure, they cut themselves on the sharp edges of the terrain. Shards of magic crystal become embedded in their wound and slowly grow, Crystallizing them. Activate a Crystal Countdown (1) for that PC. Until they remove the condition with a successful Knowledge Roll, a Crystallizing PC ticks up their Crystal Countdown at the start of each rest and has a penalty to their Evasion equal to its value. The countdown ends with the condition is cleared.
*What does the crystal look like as it grows? What does it feel like?*

***Psychic Shuffle - Reaction:*** When the PCs take a long rest, you can **spend a Fear** to swap their psyches. Collect all the players’ character sheets, then shuffle and randomly redistribute them. Each character sheet comes with that PC’s Domain cards and player aids. A PC can regain their psyche with a successful Knowledge Roll, at which point they trade sheets with the player who has their original character sheet.
*How does it feel being in someone else’s skin? If you could choose to stay like them in one way, what would it be?*
