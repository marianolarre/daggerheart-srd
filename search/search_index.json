The players, in turn, roleplay their PCs\u2019 reactions to the scenario presented by the GM. If the outcome of a player\u2019s action depends on fate or fortune, the GM calls for an action roll.</p> <p>When a player makes an action roll, they utilize Duality Dice\u2014two differently colored 12-sided dice (\u201cd12s\u201d) representing Hope and Fear. The Duality Dice are rolled, relevant modifiers are added to the results, and the total is compared to a Difficulty set by the GM. If the total meets or beats the Difficulty, the player succeeds.

The rules included in this SRD are designed to help you enjoy the experience at the table, but everyone has a different approach to interpreting rules and telling stories. The rules should never get in the way of the story you want to tell, the characters you want to play, or the adventures you want to have. As long as your group agrees, everything can be adjusted to fit your play style.

This SRD offers answers for many questions your table may have about the game, but it won\u2019t answer all of them. When you\u2019re in doubt about how a rule applies, the GM should make a ruling that aligns with the narrative.</p> <p>For example, Daggerheart has a weapon called a grappler that lets you pull a target close to you. If you try to use it to pull an entire castle, the weapon text doesn\u2019t forbid you from doing that\u2014but it doesn\u2019t make sense within the narrative. Instead, the GM might rule that you pull a few bricks out, or pull yourself toward the wall instead.</p> <p>Similarly, if your character does something that would logically result in immediate death\u2014such as diving into an active volcano without protection\u2014you might not get to make one of Daggerheart\u2019s death moves, which normally give you control of your character\u2019s fate in their final moments. This kind of consequence should be made clear before the action is completed, and it should always follow the logic of the world.</p> <p>As a narrative-focused game, Daggerheart is not a place where technical, out-of-context interpretations of the rules are encouraged. Everything should flow back to the fiction, and the GM has the authority and responsibility to make rulings about how rules are applied to underscore that fiction.</p>"},{"location":"contents/The%20Spotlight/","title":"THE SPOTLIGHT","text":"<p>The spotlight is a symbol that represents the table\u2019s attention\u2014and therefore the immediate focus of both the narrative and the game mechanics.

If the spotlight would swing to someone without any tokens, it swings to someone else instead.

The woods are dark and twisting, filled with Faint Divinities who perform small miracles and services for its inhabitants, but are just as likely to lure travelers off narrow paths to their ruin. Seemingly harmless expanses of field hide bogs that engulf entire armies, consuming heavy artillery as quickly as it can cross the border. This wilderness fosters hardy people who are bold enough to raise families where others have not and strictly follow the unique rules that keep them safe. These Wicklings remained insulated from their neighbors\u2019 wars until plague forced the people of Haven to desperate acts.</p> <p>Haven was once the most powerful force in the region; for centuries, the high stone walls into the capital bore the phrase \u201cThe Godless Gate.\u201d While the original meaning has been lost to common knowledge, some dusty tomes and ancient records state that the founders of Haven wished to be free of the influence of the Faint Divinities that dominated the surrounding regions. They hatched a plan to kill one of the mightiest of these deities, known as Shun\u2019Aush the Granite Ophid. While their exact method of deicide is forgotten, their victory ensured Haven\u2019s dominance in the region for centuries to come. They made their home behind his remains, which became the mighty walls that Haven is known for.</p> <p>But Shun\u2019Aush would have his revenge. As the Haventies carved his stone body, the fine dust left behind settled into the surrounding earth. There was a time of prosperity over many centuries while the scales of the god remained undisturbed. But progress is its own pressure. The growing population demanded increased productivity, and as farmers tilled deeper soil and miners hacked into hidden stone, the ancient stone dust rose to the surface. The same walls that brought the city security became the crucible that incubated a virulent plague.</p> <p>Over the last two years, over half of Haven\u2019s populace fell to a disease known as the Serpent\u2019s Sickness. First, victims cough up dust. Soon after, their skin breaks out in a scaling rash. Finally, their body hardens\u2014first the flesh, bones, and soft tissue, spreading until, finally, their organs ossify. Once within the organs, \u201cthe serpent\u201d moves so quickly that sufferers petrify where they stand, filling Haven with statues of victims in their last moments of agony.</p> <p>When High Magus of Haven, Archmage Phylax, discovered a rare red flower called the Crimson Bud is the only well that could cure the Serpent\u2019s Sickness. These buds grow prolifically across Fanewick in the spring\u2014but for every ten thousand of the common white-petaled blossoms, only one red flower blooms.</p> <p>Desperate to save their people from the plague, Haven invaded Fanewick to amass the scarce red buds. Their forces plunged into the deep wood and, under the guidance of Archmage Phylax, plucked out the Reaping Eye from the most powerful Faint Divinity that protected the land: The Great Owl Nikta, the Shepherd of the Seasons. The Shepherd kept Fanewick in balance by turning her eyes upon the land, first for ripening, then ruination. Thus Nikta maintained the cycle of seasons\u2014of growth and decay, of death and rebirth. With her Reaping Eye removed, Nikta can only watch over Fanewick with the Sowing Eye, forcing the land into everlasting spring.</p> <p>In the year since, Haven has conquered the bogs, turning them into fields to harvest red flowers. The endless growth that once seemed like a gift quickly evolved into a scourge known as the Witherwild\u2014Fanewick\u2019s flora and fauna flourished, unchecked and uncontrolled. Animals swell to massive size; trees warp, twist, and begin to hunt people; and vines creep along the forest floor, strangling all they touch. This explosive growth is unconquerable and unrelenting, with no force able to stop the burgeoning verdance for long.</p> <p>Prior to the Serpent\u2019s Sickness and the Shepherd\u2019s endless growth, your party lived a peaceful life in Fanewick or a life of toil and conquest in Haven.
